Eigenfaces Demo
---

## What
This is an **eigenfaces** demo written in the Octave/Matlab language to go along with [a recent blog post](http://mikedusenberry.com/on-eigenfaces/).

## Features
* Given a dataset of faces (the [cropped version](http://conradsanderson.id.au/lfwcrop/) of the [Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW)](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/) dataset), this demo computes and visualizes the _eigenfaces_, and shows the effect of projecting and recovering the original faces using these eigenfaces.

## Dev notes
* Octave 3.8.1
* `displayImages.m` is based on a utility function (non-exercise) from the [Coursera ML course](https://www.coursera.org/course/ml).
